	a. Combining selectors are used when the elements are needed to be align or same as the other elements. 
	   example is classes hd and ssd are needed to be the same as xdd, in css you will call it as .hd,.ssd,.xdd
	   for them to have the same output in a html.
	
	b. Class and ID selectors are used to make it easier for the coder to call an specific element.
	   Class is used as "." in css while ID is used as "#" in css. ID Selectors can only be apply for
	   a single element that only appears on the page for once while Class selector can be used to multiple elements.

	c. Pseudo-classes are used in css to make an effect to an element based on their state.
	   Examples are hover(when the cursor is hovering on the link text it executes a style on the link text), 
	   visited(when a link text is visited, it will execute a style on the link text) and active (when the link
	   is being viewed the link text will execute a style).

	b. ACTIVE - When the link is activated and the user is viewing it, the link text will executes a style.
	c. VISITED - When the link is visited the link text will executes a style.
	d. LINK - When the link is unvisited the link text will executes a style.
